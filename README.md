I have created a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators(KPI) and metrics in the dataset.
The KPI I worked on this projects are 
  1) Overall Customer satisfaction
  2) Overall calls answered/ abandoned
  3) Calls by time
  4) Average speed of answer
  5) Agent's Performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
